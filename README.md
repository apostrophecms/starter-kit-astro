# Apostrophe starter kit for Astro integration

This is intended as a starting point for an Apostrophe project with a
separate front end powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

To complete your project, you will need to fork **both** this project
and our [astro-frontend](https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend) project.

Also see the [Apostrophe documentation](https://v3.docs.apostrophecms.org/). Note
that documentation regarding Nunjucks templates, frontend assets, etc. does not
apply when using an Astro front end because these become the responsibility of
Astro. On the other hand, documentation about schema fields, page types, piece
types, widget types, event handlers and many other topics remains very
relevant when working with Astro.

Please see the [@apostrophecms/apostrophe-astro](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-astro) documentation
for complete information about how to get started with this project.
